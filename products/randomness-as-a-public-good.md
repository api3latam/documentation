# Randomness as a Public Good

### Philosophy

> Public Good, refers to something that anyone can use! We are democratizing access to dAPIs trough fair use.

> Randomness On Chain, brings a capability that native Solidity doesn't have as per the determinist nature of blockchain technologies, which makes it impossible to have true randomness on chain.

So, we are working towards an easy and publicly available access to true randomness for dapps, so anyone can make the best use out of API3 technologies.
